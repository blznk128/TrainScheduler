Instructions

Make sure that your app suits this basic spec:
When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
Train Name
Destination 
First Train Time -- in military time
Frequency -- in minutes
Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time.
Users from many different machines must be able to view same train times.

This application got me even more excited about coding. When I completed it and I was able to have my friends use the application on their computers and I got to see the trains they added was very awesome for me.
