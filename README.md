# TrainScheduler

Moment.js and trying to figure out the time was pretty intense. I referenced the activites a million times, still need a lot practice doing it because a look at the code and get lost reading it sometimes. On a side note, work was insane lately cause of labor day so didn't have the time to make it look pretty like I wanted =(
